<h1>Work</h1>

<p class="space">The following is a selection of my design work from 2018 through 2022. The examples depict the final result, but really, the work happened through hundreds of sketches, sticky notes, contextual inquiries, experiments, prototypes, design reviews, user tests, demos and more.</p>

<h2>Kena App</h2>

<p>Kena is an app that connects anyone to a nurse, doctor or mental health professional, for telemedicine-based care. I led the design, build and market launch of Kena. The design covered everything from onboarding, authentication, chat-based case triage, clinician interaction (text, voice or video call), consultation followup and prescription/sick-note/referral document sharing. 4 months after launch the registration conversion rate was over 80%, the app was ranked #1 on the Play Store and #3 on the App Store in the medical category, it had an app store rating of 4.8, and we're completing over 3000 consultations monthly (growing by over 10% month-on-month).</p>

<h2>Kena Brand</h2>

<p>I oversaw the design of the Kena brand, for the launch of the telemedicine service in South Africa. I led the team to design something that was distinct from the staid, soft blue that is archetypal of healthcare—while still depicting the vitality and wellbeing that our team-based healthcare aims to provide.</p>

<h2>Kena Clinic</h2>

<p>I designed the product that clinicians (nurses, doctors, mental health professionals, care coordinators etc) use to provide care to patients through the Kena app. Clinicians use the product to capture and maintain health records for their patients, as well as to create prescriptions, sick notes, referrals and other documents as part of the care they provide. I designed the product to enable team-based care—that is, to promote clinician teamwork through efficient coordination and communication.</p>

<h2>Absa's Banking App</h2>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/absa-banking-app.png" alt="Evolution of Absa's banking app">

<p class="space">I led the design team responsible for Absa's banking app. I led a redesign of the app as part of a rebrand, and the design and implementation of a design system that enabled the app to scale to all the product lines of the bank (home loans, asset finance, wealth management, credit card, savings etc). The app was rated 4.7 out of 5, and the number of users grew by 60% year-on-year, to over 2 million monthly active users. Shown above is the first redesign that I led (the 2 mockups on the left), followed by a major overhaul to account for the expansion of services 3 years later (the 2 mockups on the right). <a href="https://youtu.be/jAkAwDPwAks">Here's the very first prototype</a> that I built that got the first redesign started.</p>

<h2>Stub</h2>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/stub.png" alt="Stub">

<p>I helped to establish Stub, an invoicing and accounting product that helps small business owners make smart financial choices, by giving them timely, useful insights about the finances of their business. I designed the product to be incredibly simple to use, so that anyone—no matter their financial know-how or experience—can run their company. I designed the product, as well as the brand and I built the majority of the front-end (it's Vue.js powered by a combination of Clojure and Firebase).</p>
