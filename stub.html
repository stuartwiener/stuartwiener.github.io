    <h1>Stub</h1>

    <p>Stub is a tenacious idea born of friendship, discovery and a <em>why don’t we just try</em> attitude.</p>

    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-landing.jpg"  alt="">

    <h2>How it started</h2>

    <p>Stub began in 2019 when 3 friends started commuting together to work. We love our jobs (it wasn’t a case of us needing or even wanting to do something else), but in our conversations we started seeing some patterns in financial services for businesses.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>8 out of 10 new businesses fail in their first year in South Africa.</li>
        <li>One reason for this is cashflow. It’s really hard to get money flowing into a new business, and it’s hard to deploy that money effectively</li>
        <li>Another reason for this is a skills gap. Many business owners don’t know where the opportunities to grow their businesses really are, because they are wholly focused on the day-to-day reality of running their organisations.</li>
        <li>A third reason for this is simply a lack of information. Many business owners have all their energy focused on survival. They don’t have time or attention for anything else.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Even if a business survives past its first year, the reality is that most small businesses lack the information they need to make critical decisions. Financial information is usually spread across different systems, often in incompatible formats. Even if the information is available it’s often not available in real-time.</p>

    <p>Many accounting platforms claim to solve all of these problems, but in practice they are difficult to use, made for finance professionals or require lengthy and complicated set up. <em>Ain’t no business owner got time for that.</em></p>

    <h2>Idea</h2>

    <p>We asked ourselves a crazy question: seeing as nobody else seemed to be doing it, could we design and make a financial management platform that was really easy to use? One that would empower entrepreneurs who might not be finance professionals? One that would get the job done quickly and then get out of the way so that business owners could spend their time doing other things? One that was smart and could see potential problems coming before they turned into deadly problems?</p>

    <p>And, with that, Stub was born.</p>

    <h2>Experiment</h2>

    <p>The first thing we did was question all of our assumptions. When we spoke to business owners they all complained about these problems, but would they actually be willing to embrace (and pay for) an alternative?</p>

    <p>We registered a domain and set up a social media profile to test our hypotheses.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-signup.jpg"  alt="">

    <p class="sidebar">Yeah, that first version didn’t have much going for it. </p>

    <p>We set up a marketing website with a signup form and started posting on Instagram. We promoted a few posts a week later (with very little spend) and after 5 days, 100 people had signed up on our website.</p>

    <h2>Product</h2>

    <p>Over the next 6 months we built and launched the first version of Stub.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-dashboard.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>I designed and built the front-end while my co-founders look after marketing and server development respectively. In practice we collaborate on practically everything and everyone lends a hand wherever it is needed. Stub is inextricably the result of the 3 of us.</p>

    <p>We used vue.js for the front-end and Clojure running on Heroku, with a bit of Firebase mixed in, for our server. The whole system is very quick. It feels sparkly and alert.</p>

    <h2>Brand design</h2>

    <p>We needed an actual brand—the word mark with weird capitalisation was getting old fast.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-ideation.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>I tried a lot of different ideas—a scribbled dot, some layered arrows, an “S” bent out of shape—before we settled on the “high five”. </p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-viable-ideas.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Of all the viable options the <em>high five</em> feels most like us. It says, ”Just start! Take action! Get moving! You can do it! Boom!" And the thumb subtly terminates running upward like a chart showing growth.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-logo-tshirt.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Of course getting a logo to work on a t-shirt like this was the easy part.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-logo-tab.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>It also needed to work on social media, on a tab in a web browser and on an app icon. In those cases it needed to be distinct and recognisable. A word mark wouldn’t scale down to those sizes, so the logo needed to be able to stand on its own. We tested it in all of these scenarios and refined all of the details until it worked consistently well in each case.</p>

    <h2>Product design</h2>

    <p>We spoke extensively with some of the people that signed up on our marketing website and we identified 3 people whom we felt we could serve well, and who represented different sides of our addressable market. The one thing that they they all needed was invoicing, so we knew that we had to get that right to get into the game.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoice-0.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>I designed an invoice editor that used a direct manipulation paradigm, so that it would feel familiar to people who use MS Word to make and send invoices (a lot of people do this).</p>

    <p>I felt that I could simplify it even further and we agreed that it needed to feel less heavy and cumbersome, so that it didn’t intimidate users.</p>

    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoice-1.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>The micro-interactions would need to make it feel effortless and they had to work extra hard to create the right affordances that would teach users what they could do as they used it.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoice-2.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Once I had something that we felt had enough potential we moved over to solving those problems in code, iterating over and over until it was sufficiently polished.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoice-3.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>If we pushed the direct manipulation paradigm too far we found that it actually made the system harder to use.</p>
    <p>Modals are always tricky as they can feel like an interruption that gets in the way of what you’re trying to do. They can also create focus when they’re done right and I found that our users were able to complete complex tasks without getting tripped up, using our customised modals.</p> 
    <p>The content on our modals is preloaded so that they load immediately, making the system feel very lively and responsive. This is subtle, but it makes a remarkable difference to the experience.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoices.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Once we had established the conventions, it was about ensuring that they were applied consistently. As I worked through each instance I refined the conventions holistically, taking into account the nuances of each section.</p>

    <p>Most accounting platforms group both income and expenses into a singular “transactions” element. You can generally add a “transaction” and then decide whether it is money coming in or going out. But the more we spoke to our users and watched what they did, the more we realised how differently they treated income as opposed to expenses. While they might be equivalent at a data level (distinguished only by a positive/negative sign), we decided to distinguish them in the navigation for the user. In this way we handle each separately, which gives the user a much clearer understanding and consideration of each. This turned out to work really well for our early users. </p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-income.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Throughout the process we had to solve for mobile as well. I built everything mobile first and since we ended up designing a lot of the details in code this was quite natural.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-mobile.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>It turns out that a large proportion of our customers use WhatsApp to send their invoices.</p>

    <h2>What next?</h2>

    <p>We have a backlog of hundreds of potential features, but by keeping it lean and aiming for quality over quantity we’ve got a platform that’s steadily growing.</p>

    <p>We’ve acquired a number of paying customers, and we're actively building (when we can) to grow our market.</p>

    <p>At the moment Stub is useful to a small group of entrepreneurs which is immensely rewarding. We're looking some options to grow Stub from here, but the venture capital environment is not particularly mature in Africa, so our options are limited.</p>
