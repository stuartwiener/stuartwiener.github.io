    <h1>Stub</h1>

    <p>Stub is a tenacious idea born of friendship, discovery and a <em>why don’t we just try</em> attitude.</p>

    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-landing.jpg"  alt="">

    <h2>How it started</h2>

    <p>Stub is a side project that began in 2019 when 3 friends started commuting together to work. In our conversations we realised that we were all seeing some similar patterns in South Africa.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>At least 7 out of 10 new businesses fail in their first year in South Africa.</li>
        <li>One reason for this is cashflow. It’s really hard to get money flowing into a new business, and it’s hard to deploy that money effectively. Capital for new ventures is not readily available in South Africa.</li>
        <li>Another reason for this is a lack of skills. Many business owners don’t know where the opportunities to grow their businesses really are, because they are wholly focused on the day-to-day reality of running their organisations.</li>
        <li>A third reason for this is simply a lack of information. Many business owners have all their energy focused on survival. Ironically, they don’t have time or attention for anything else.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Even if a business survives past its first year, the reality is that most small businesses lack the information that they need to make critical decisions. Financial information is usually spread across different systems, often in incompatible formats. Even if the information is available it’s often not available in real-time.</p>

    <p>Many accounting platforms claim to solve all of these problems, but in practice they are either difficult to use, made primarily for finance professionals or require lengthy and complicated set up.</p>
    
    <p><em>Ain’t no business owner got time for that.</em></p>

    <h2>Idea</h2>

    <p>We asked ourselves a crazy question...</p>

    <p>Seeing as nobody else seemed to be doing it, could we make a financial management platform that was really easy to use? One that would empower entrepreneurs who might not be finance professionals? One that would mostly just get out of the way so that business owners could spend their time doing other things? One that was smart and could see potential problems coming before they turned into deadly problems?</p>

    <p>And with that, Stub was born.</p>

    <h2>Experiment</h2>

    <p>The first thing we did was question all of our assumptions. When we spoke to business owners they all complained about these problems, but would they actually be willing to embrace (and pay for) an alternative?</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-signup.jpg"  alt="">

    <p class="sidebar">Yeah, that first version didn’t have much going for it. </p>

    <p>We set up a marketing website with a signup form and started posting on Instagram. We promoted 2 or 3 posts (with very little spend) and after 5 days, over 100 people had signed up on our website.</p>

    <h2>Product</h2>

    <p>Over the next 6 months we built and launched the first version of Stub.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-dashboard.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>I designed and built the front-end while my co-founders looked after marketing and server development respectively. In practice we collaborate on practically everything and everyone lends a hand wherever it is needed. Stub is irreducably the 3 of us.</p>

    <p>We used Vue.js for the front-end and Clojure running on Heroku, with a bit of Firebase mixed in, for our server. The whole system is very quick. It feels sparkly and responsive. And it scales.</p>

    <h2>Brand design</h2>

    <p>To start with we needed some branding. The word mark that we had been using up to that point was getting old fast.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-ideation.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>I tried a lot of different ideas—a scribbled dot, some layered arrows, an “S” bent out of shape—but in the end we settled on a “high five”. </p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-viable-ideas.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Of all the viable options the <em>high five</em> feels most like us. It says, ”Just start! Take action! Get moving! You can do it! Let’s go!" And the thumb subtly terminates pointing upward like a chart trending positively.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-logo-tshirt.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Of course getting a logo to work on a t-shirt like this was the easy part.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-logo-tab.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>It also needed to work on social media, on a tab in a web browser and on an app icon. In those cases it needed to be distinct and recognisable. A word mark wouldn’t scale down to those sizes, so the logo needed to be able to stand on its own. I tested it in all of these scenarios and refined all of the details until it worked consistently well in each case.</p>

    <h2>Product design</h2>

    <p>We spoke extensively with some of the people that signed up on our marketing website and we identified 3 people whom we felt were good representatives of different extremes of our addressable market. The one thing that they they all needed was invoicing, so we knew that we had to get that right to get into the game.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoice-0.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>I designed an invoice editor that used a direct manipulation paradigm, so that it would feel familiar to people who use Microsoft Word to make and send invoices (a lot of people do this).</p>

    <p>I felt that I could simplify it even further and we agreed that it needed to feel less heavy and cumbersome, so that it didn’t intimidate users.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-dashboard-v1.jpg"  alt="">

    <p class="sidebar">I explored other parts of the platform to start getting a sense of the design system that we would need and I conceptualised a feed of recommendations and insights.</p>

    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoice-1.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Once I had something that we felt had potential we moved over to solving those problems in code, iterating over and over until it was sufficiently polished.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoice-2.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>The micro-interactions needed to work hard to create the right affordances at particular moments, so that they steadily built our customer’s confidence, showing them how to do things as they used Stub more and more.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoice-3.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>If we pushed the direct manipulation paradigm too far we found that it actually made the system harder to use.</p>
    <p>Modals are always tricky as they can feel like an interruption that gets in the way of what you’re trying to do. When they're done right though, they can generate focus and efficiency, and I found that our users were able to complete complex tasks without getting tripped up, using our customised modals.</p> 
    <p>The content on our modals is pre-loaded so that the modal loads immediately, making the system feel very lively. This is subtle, but it makes a remarkable difference to the experience.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-invoices.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>Once we had established the conventions, it was about ensuring that they were applied consistently. As I worked through each instance I refined the conventions holistically, taking into account the nuances of each section.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-income.jpg"  alt="">

    <p class="sidebar">Most accounting platforms group both income and expenses into a singular “transactions” element. You can usually add a “transaction” to a general ledger and then decide whether it is money coming in or going out. But the more we spoke to our users and watched what they did, the more we realised how differently they treated income versus expenses. While they might be equivalent at a data level (distinguished only by a positive/negative sign), we decided to separate them in the navigation for the user. This gives the user a much clearer understanding and consideration of each. For overall reporting we still consolidate the two, but handling them independantly turned out to work really well for our early users. </p>

    <p>Throughout the process we had to solve for mobile. I built everything mobile first and since we ended up designing a lot of the details in code it was quite natural to create conventions that worked across mobile, tablet and desktop devices.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-mobile.jpg"  alt="">

    <p>We learnt from our users as we went along, not only listening to what they said, but watching and measuring what they did. For example, it turned out that many users sent invoices to their clients using WhatsApp, and we could quickly accomodate and facilitate that.</p>

    <img class="narrow" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/stub-email.jpg"  alt="">

    <p class="sidebar">We used MJML to create responsive email templates for invoices, that could also be rendered on web. MJML is not perfect, but we found it to be a good trade-off between flexibility, consistency across different email clients and maintainability.</p>

    <p>Building and launching Stub was a continuous dance between focusing on the details of a particular interface or technology and stepping back to consider the product value as a whole—much like painting where you add a brushstroke and then take a step back to see it in context of the rest of the canvas, before adding the next brushstroke and repeating.</p>

    <h2>What’s next?</h2>

    <p>We have a backlog of hundreds of potential features, but by keeping it lean and aiming for quality over quantity we’ve got a platform that’s steadily growing.</p>

    <p>At the moment Stub is useful to a small group of entrepreneurs and that is immensely rewarding. We’ve acquired a number of paying customers, and we’re actively building (when we can) to grow our market.</p>
