<h3>Experience</h3>

<h1>Product Design Director</h1>
<h2>Absa Group Limited ∙ Aug 2017 – Present</h2>
<p>At Absa, I'm the Product Design Director for mobile banking. In other words, I lead the team of designers who shape Absa's banking app.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I lead 14 designers working across 7 squads, each squad made up of engineers, product owners and others.</li>
    <li>Our work covers everything from customer discovery (contextual/ethnographic research), through concept development (ideation and prototyping), through concept validation (user testing) and delivery.</li>
    <li>I introduced a design system of components, templates and principles to scale a consistent customer experience, as well as accelerate delivery through standardisation.</li>
    <li>I lead the end-to-end redesign of the mobile banking app, as part of Absa's rebrand in 2018.</li>
    <li>I shipped a chat-based banking solution built on WhatsApp.</li>
    <li>I introduced a measurement framework to validate our qualitative customer insights with quantitative data about user outcomes, for every new feature that we ship.</li>
    <li>Since joining Absa the App Store rating for the banking app has gone from 2.7 to 4.7 out of 5 (on Android and iOS). The user base has grown by about 60% year-on-year, to 1.4 million active users.</li>
    <li>I’ve worked with the other design directors to <em>design</em> the design organisation at Absa. Specifically, I created the growth and development framework for our designers.</li>
    <li>I helped develop our grad program, which was in response to a lack of quality design skills in SA. We take graduate-level designers through a one year program of accelerated learning.</li>
