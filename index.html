<h1>Stuart Wiener</h1>

<p>I am a designer, product strategist and digital maker, living and working from Johannesburg, South Africa. I work with courageous organisations to make digital products and services that <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/aiming-for-originality-in-design-db95f164e5b3">don't suck</a>.</p>

<p>For the past 10 years or so I've designed and built websites, apps and experiences, while working in marketing (with Ogilvy), in consulting (with Deloitte Digital), and as part of a digital product team (with Absa)â€”as well as <a href="/resume/">a few others...</a></p>

<p>My work focusses on helping modern product teams ship great solutions to market, so that they have an impact and realise their potential.</p>
