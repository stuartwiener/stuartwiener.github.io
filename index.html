<p>I’m a designer, product strategist and digital maker living and working from sunny Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>

<p>I've worked in software development, media production, marketing, consulting and as part of an in-house product team. I work with brave organisations to make digital products and services that are <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/aiming-for-originality-in-design-db95f164e5b3">radically better</a>, by applying modern, systematic design.</p>
