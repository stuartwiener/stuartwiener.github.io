<h1>Hi. I’m Stuart.</h1>

<div class="content">

    <p>I’m a designer from sunny South Africa.</p>

    <p>I lead a diverse and passionate team of designers at <a href="{% link absa.html %}">Absa bank</a> who are responsible for Absa’s transactional banking app. I’ve spent a number of years learning about people’s relationship with money (it’s complicated) and shaping financial services to serve them. </p>

    <p>Together with 2 co-founders I also started a company called <a href="{% link stub.html %}">Stub</a>, with a mission to help more small businesses in Africa succeed. We help entrepreneurs keep track of their finances, get paid for their work and make smart, informed financial choices.</p>

    <p class="sidebar">When I’m not working, I’m probably spending time with my family, going for a run, cooking a meal with a friend, playing guitar, painting or drawing something, or just exploring beautiful Southern Africa. You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/StuartWiener" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stuartwiener/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com/stuartwiener" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuartwiener/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stuartwiener" target="_blank">Github</a> — though I’m more likely to be reading a book.</p>

    <p class="sidebar">Please <a onclick="window.location.href='mailto:hello'+'@'+'stuartwiener.com';">email me</a> if you would like to get in touch.</p>

    <p class="sidebar">Want to know more? Here's my <a href="{% link experience.html %}">detailed profile and career experience</a>.</p>
