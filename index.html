<h1>Hi, I’m Stuart 👋</h1>

<div class="content">

    <p class="supertext">I’m a design leader from sunny South Africa.</p>
    
    <p class="supertext">I lead a diverse and passionate team of designers at Absa Bank, who are responsible for Absa’s transactional banking app, used by millions of people. I’ve spent a number of years learning about people’s relationship with money (it’s complicated) and shaping financial services to serve them.</p>

    <p class="supertext">My work is organised around shipping digital products that people love, building strong teams and helping designers grow and flourish. </p>
