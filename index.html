<h1>Hi, I’m Stuart.</h1>

<p>I’m Head of Product at <a href="https://healthforce.io">Healthforce</a> in sunny South Africa, where we're working to deliver compassionate, affordable healthcare to everyone.</p>

<p>Before that I was Design Director for mobile banking at Absa Bank, and before that—well, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuartwiener/">here you go...</a></p>

<p>In my career I've been really lucky to work with lots of smart, talented people to design and build all sorts of different products. These days I spend my time building strong, resilient teams that deliver products that humans love.</p>
