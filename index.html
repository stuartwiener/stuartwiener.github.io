<p>I’m a designer living and working in Johannesburg, South Africa. I work as a Product Design Director (for mobile banking) at Barclays Africa Group Limited.</p>

<p>The only design advice I can give you (unless we have a coffee together sometime) is...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything—seriously, <em>everything</em>—is designed.</li>
  <li><em>Why?</em> is probably the most useful question to ask.</li>
  <li>Curiosity is a prerequisite for making something great.</li>
  <li>Humans are complex, unpredictable and wonderful.</li>
  <li>You can learn a lot by listening and paying attention.</li>
  <li>You have to make something wrong before you can make it right.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to make something <em>not bad</em>. You must be brave to make it <em>great</em>.</li>
  <li>Stop reading this and go play outside.</li>
</ul>
