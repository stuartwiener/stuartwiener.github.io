<p>I’m Head of Product at <a href="https://healthforce.io">Healthforce</a>, based in sunny South Africa, where we're working to deliver compassionate, affordable healthcare to everyone.</p>

<p>In my career I've been really lucky to work with lots of smart, capable people to design and build all sorts of different products, in all sorts of different contexts. Now I spend my time building strong, resilient teams that deliver products that humans love.</p>
