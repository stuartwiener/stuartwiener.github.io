<p>I’m a product designer and design thinker living and working in Johannesburg, South Africa. I work as a Product Design Director (for mobile banking) at Barclays Africa Group Limited.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is designed</li>
  <li>“Why?” is probably the most useful question</li>
  <li>Curiosity is a prerequisite</li>
  <li>Humans are complex</li>
  <li>Understanding is worthwhile</li>
  <li>Understanding is hard work</li>
  <li>Problems preceed solutions</li>
  <li>The process is never straightforward</li>
  <li>Think by making</li>
  <li>Write to think</li>
</ul>
