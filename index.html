<p>I’m a designer living and working in Johannesburg, South Africa. I work as a Product Design Director (for mobile banking) at Barclays Africa.</p>

<p>To <em>design</em> is to consciously and intuitively shape any thing. Everything is designed—seriously, <em>everything</em>—and you are a designer.</p>

<p>Curiosity killed the cat, but there is no record of it ever killing a designer.</p>

<p>People are complex, surprising, wonderful and different to you and I.</p>

<p>There’s a world brimming with gold if you listen and pay careful attention.</p>

<p>New and different is relatively easy. Actual progress takes some serious work.</p>

<p>Be brave. Stop reading this and start.</p>
