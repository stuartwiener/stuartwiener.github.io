<p>Hi. I'm Stuart. I'm a designer working at the intersection of humanity and technology. I build human-centred products and services (mostly websites and apps) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuartwiener/">I lead teams</a> to do the same. I also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stuartwiener/">make photographs</a>.</p>

<p>I value empathy, craftsmanship, simplicity, harmony, clarity and continuous discovery. I'm committed to developing original ideas and I work with leaders and founders to make that happen.</p>

<p>Please reach out to me through <a onclick="window.location.href='mailto:hello'+'@'+'stuartwiener.com';">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/stuartwiener">@stuartwiener</a>.</p>
