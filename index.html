<h1>Hi. I’m Stuart.</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>I’m a designer from sunny South Africa. Over the course of my career I’ve designed and shipped software for many different platforms (once even for a custom IC, as part of an access management system 🤷‍♂️). </p>

<p>These days, I lead teams that design and make products. I think about leading people as a design problem: there are questions of human needs and goals, there’s the persistent and explorative process that it takes to make anything worthwhile, there’s the scale and context of what needs to be done and the impact that we all want to have. I work to build resilient teams, forging strong and healthy relationships between team members, developing leaders, coaching designers and creating an environment for people to do the best work of their lives.</p>

<p>I lead a diverse and passionate team of designers at Absa bank who are responsible for designing Absa’s banking app. I’ve spent a number of years learning about people’s relationship with money (it’s complicated) and shaping financial services to serve them. </p>

<p>Together with 2 cofounders I also started a company called <a href="https://stub.africa">Stub</a>, where our mission is to help more small businesses in Africa succeed. We’ve built a platform that helps entrepreneurs keep track of their finances, get paid for their work and make smart financial choices, informed by our insights engine. It’s growing.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I’m probably spending time with my family, going for a run, cooking up a storm, playing guitar, painting or drawing something, or just exploring beautiful Southern Africa. You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/StuartWiener">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stuartwiener/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com/stuartwiener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stuartwiener">Github</a>, but I’m also more likely to be reading a book.</p>

<p>You can <a onclick="window.location.href='mailto:hello'+'@'+'stuartwiener.com';">email me</a> to get in touch. </p>
