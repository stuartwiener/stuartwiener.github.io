<h1>Hi, I’m Stuart</h1>

<p>I’m a design leader from sunny South Africa.</p>

<p>I lead a diverse and passionate team of designers at Absa Bank, who are responsible for Absa’s transactional banking app. I’ve spent a number of years learning about people’s relationship with money (it’s complicated) and shaping financial services to serve them.</p>

<p>My work is organised around shipping digital products that people love and building strong, resilient design teams.</p>
