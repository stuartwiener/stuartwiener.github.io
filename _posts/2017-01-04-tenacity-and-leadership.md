For any venture to succeed it must undoubtably face, and overcome, considerable challenges. These challenges could be a clash of personalities, shifts in the market, changes in technology, changes in process, competitors, scaling issues and so on. The point is that they will come.

This is why *tenacity*—that is the unwavering belief that seemingly impossible things can be achieved if you’re willing to try and to persevere—is so important for effective leadership. Anyone is intimidated by the first step on the proverbial thousand step journey, but leaders know that it’s only by taking that step, and then the next, and then the next, and so on, that the journey will ever be accomplished—and therefore they possess *an unhesitating willingness to try*.
