Any venture that will succeed will undoubtably face considerable challenges—its defining difference will be that it overcomes those challenges while others do not. These could be a clash of personalities, shifts in the market, changes in technology, changes in process, scaling issues and so on. The point is that they will come. 

As a leader you must be willing to lead your organisation through such challenges, and this is why tenacity—that is the unwavering belief that seemingly impossible things can be achieved if you’re willing to try and to persevere—is so important for effective leadership. Anyone is intimidated by the first step on the proverbial thousand kilometre journey, but leaders know that it’s only by taking that step, and then the next, and then the next, and so on, that the journey will ever be accomplished—and therefore they possess *an unhesitating willingness to try*.

Leaders must possess a willingness to go ahead of those that they are leading, showing implicitly that they are not daunted by the journey, long and challenging though it may be. This cue to everyone sets the tone for how an organisation faces both *hard work* and the *unknown* (without which no new value will be created).

To a large degree the perception of a challenge is much worse than the actual challenge itself and therefore the tenacity to start—to take action and begin—is of utmost importance. The persistence to continue is much easier when momentum has been created, progress is actually being made (however small), and the organisation is preoccupied with *doing* rather than than being intimidated by *starting*.
