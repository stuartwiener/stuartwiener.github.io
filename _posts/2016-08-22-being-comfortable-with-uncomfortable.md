One of my favourite talks about creativity comes from John Cleese. He talks about how part of human nature is to desire *certainty* and *completeness*. That nature can be at odds with creative ideation, because creativity requires exploring many options, dancing from one idea to the next—literally *searching* for original, interesting recombinations.

The talk is fascinating and insightful—I would encourage you to watch it from start to finish—and in it John Cleese talks about a number of strategies that help address our biases. But it also made me think of a maxim of design, which is to

> Fall in love with the problem—not the solution. 

Something I see not just designers doing routinely, but also business consultants and strategists, is to latch on to the first available solution to a problem, because of its promise of resolution, not its actual viability. This maxim is helpful, in a sense, because it reframes the goal or objective of the creative endeavour. When the problem is the important bit, then the solution can adapt and change to fit it. It’s also interesting to consider how this approach fits with *agile* and *lean* methodologies, which favour learning and adaptability over finality and immutability.
