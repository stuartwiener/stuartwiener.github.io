Writing forms such a large part of what we do. I spend ages hunting for the right way to say something because I know that the words that I use shape so much of what we do (*email* I’m looking at you and rolling my eyes). But attention is scarce, so while we deal with complexity all the time, we have to be increasingly economical with our words.

This is especially typical for product managers, who have to write a lot of concise content describing things like *working principles*, *guiding statements*, *product features* and the like. *Playbooks* are everywhere these days—it turns out that codifying principles about how to work generates consensus and alignment (if they’re good principles and people read them). 

*Starting with a verb* is a great strategy for articulating ideas or instructions effectively. Often, I either get writer’s block trying to articulate something perfectly, or I wander from the point. Starting a sentence with a verb, mostly mitigates both of those problems, because it forces me to describe (with just one word) the *action* that is important. This is effective even when writing content that describes or explains something, because it forces me to orientate the content around the *signal* that is most critical. Also, it gets me started writing. Once you’re writing you can write as much as you like and edit it later, but starting is often the hardest.

Hat tip to my colleague [Philip Langley](http://twitter.com/philiplangleyza) for suggesting this to me.
