Towards the end of this fascinating short film, Matthew Carter reflects on how the creative process has changed. As a type cutter at Enschede, he would produce perhaps only a single letter in a day. Today, designers can use type design software to create many letters in a single day. Instead of initially planning a design very carefully before executing it, a designer can explore many different options and essentially *choose the best one*.

This is interesting because today this trend to *think by making* has extended well beyond the reaches of graphic design—it applies to organisations, systems and *design* of almost any kind (*The Lean Startup* lays out a framework for applying this kind of thinking to building businesses). 

That said, it is still challenging to apply this sort of approach to some fields. Could an architect verify the effectiveness of a building while actually building it—and course-correct where necessary? This is the challenge of any design: the effectiveness of a design feature is postulated based on a legacy of success or failure. Important, instructive information may be more accessible than ever before (e.g. Wikipedia), but it does not cover all cases—certainly not those of original ideation. We can’t rapidly iterate a building right now, but if Moore’s law continues on trend, who knows what our processes could look like 10 years from now.
