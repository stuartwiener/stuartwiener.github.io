Towards the end of this fascinating short film, Matthew Carter reflects on how the creative process has changed. As a type cutter at Enschede, he would produce perhaps only a single letter in a day. Today, designers can use type design software to create many letters in a single day. Instead of initially planning a design very carefully before executing it, a designer can explore many different options and essentially *choose the best one*.

This is interesting because today this trend to *think by making* has extended well beyond the reaches of traditional graphic designâ€”it applies to organisations, systems and *design* of almost any kind: *The Lean Startup* lays out a framework for applying this kind of thinking to *designing* businesses.
