We’ve been saying this thing around the office quite a bit recently: “Meet your client where they are at.”

It’s simple really, just suspend your beliefs for half a moment and try to empathise with someone else’s point of view. But it’s remarkably hard. As a consultant it’s easy to think that we have the answers—we’re often just expected to—but it’s always dangerous to assume that we know the answer before we’ve really understood what’s going on.

Listening to people isn’t just about convincing them of an alternative point of view—it’s the only way that they will ever come to own the new information for themselves and that is what ultimately leads to impact. And the only we way may discover that we are wrong (*gasp*), is if we embrace the possibility of another point of view.
