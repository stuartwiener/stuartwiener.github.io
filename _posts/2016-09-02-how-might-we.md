Great ideas come from great questions. Bad ideas come from bad questions. It’s remarkable how many projects start out on an ill-formed premise—a bad question. Naturally, this means that starting by evaluating the question being asked—that is, the foundation of the desire for change—is the single most important step that you can take. 

[*How might we…*](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/hmw-methodcard.pdf) is a great tool for doing this. It reframes the premise in such a way that you are forced to evaluate the underlying assumptions. For example, instead of, “We need to update the content on our website”, the question, “*How might we* help our website visitors when they don’t have much time and they need to know how to find one of our locations” is much more constructive. 

- *How* implies that we are open to possibilities. 
- *Might* implies that there are many possibilities out there (some naturally better than others) that are worth exploring.
- *We* implies a collaborative effort, where each person’s input is valued.

Those seemingly small changes to our approach can make an incredible difference to the outcomes of what we do.
