<div class="experience">
    <div class="header">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/absa.svg" alt="Absa Bank">
        <div>
            <h2>Design Director at Absa Bank</h2>
            <h4>Aug 2017 – <em>Present</em></h4>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I lead the design team responsible for Absa’s banking app. We work closely with product leaders, engineers, business partners and our other channels to design and ship financial services to customers. Our design work covers everything from discovery, concept development, detailed design, validation and delivery.</p>
        <p class="subtext">In 2018 I initiated and led a <a href="{% link absa.html %}">full redesign of the app</a> as part of an overall bank rebrand. We fixed the information architecture and implemented a design system for the app. This provided the fundamental framework for the growth of the app since. At the same time, I led the design of the first WhatsApp-based banking service at Absa (and in the world, at the time).</p>
        <p class="subtext">Since we redesigned the app I’ve led many projects to design and ship financial services to  customers, evolving the app along the way.</p>
        <p class="subtext">My work has resulted in Absa’s App Store rating improving from 2.7 to 4.7 out of 5, on both iOS and Android. The number of active customers using the app has grown by approximately 60% year-on-year, to 1.8m active users today. Customer engagement has gone from about 1 session per week to over 20 sessions per month.</p>
        <p class="subtext">I've also shaped the design organisation at Absa. I created a skill development framework for designers to work with their mentors to grow their design skills. I helped develop our grad program. And I’ve hired and mentored many designers across the teams.</p>

            <h2>Founder at Stub</h2>
            <h4>Jun 2019 – <em>Present</em></h4>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Together with 2 co-founders, I started a company called <a href="{% link stub.html %}">Stub</a> with a mission to help more small businesses in Africa grow and succeed.</p>
        <p class="subtext">Stub is an invoicing and accounting platform that is really easy to use, so that anyone, no matter their financial know-how, can manage their money. It automates some common tasks, helping business owners get paid quickly. And as people use our toolset it learns about their business and provides insights into their specific market. I oversee the product and I designed and built the front-end.</p>
        <p class="subtext">We’ve validated that Stub is something that people actually want—we’ve acquired a few passionate (and paying) customers, and we’re actively building to grow our market.</p>
        <p class="subtext">We’ve built a small, close-knit team where we debate ideas strongly and frankly, always exploring different product possibilities. We’re in a very early stage of the business and looking at options of how we might scale and grow.</p>

        <p>I co-founded an online retail company. We sold and installed audio and media systems for clients like schools, theatres and live production venues.</p>
        <p class="subtext">I designed the brand, built and managed the website, developed marketing programmes, and managed all of the digital infrastructure, while my co-founder negotiated with our suppliers, managed our inventory and serviced our customers—all while we both sold as much as we could.</p>
        <p class="subtext">To differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive market we tried many different strategies—even developing our own line of custom guitar effects pedals.</p>
        <p class="subtext">Ultimately, in 2018, we decided to close the business as we were all moving into different life stages and we wanted to explore new opportunities. I’m most proud that we’re all still great friends to this day.</p>
